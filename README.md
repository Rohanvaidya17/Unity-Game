# Unity-Game

Start by creating a new scene in your Unity project. Add a plane to serve as the ground by navigating to GameObject > 3D Object > Plane, then scale it to approximately (10, 1, 10) and position it at the origin (0, 0, 0). To enable navigation, open the Navigation window via Window > AI > Navigation, select the plane, and check “Navigation Static” in the Inspector. Then, go to the Bake tab and click “Bake” to generate the NavMesh on the plane. Next, create a Game Manager by adding an empty GameObject and naming it "GameManager", then attach a custom script named GameManager.cs to handle any global logic. For visual feedback when clicking, create a click marker prefab by adding a small disc or cylinder (GameObject > 3D Object > Cylinder), scaling it to about (0.5, 0.1, 0.5). Add a ClickMarker.cs script to this object to control its behavior, and apply a new material with transparency enabled for a subtle effect. Once set up, drag this object into the Project window to turn it into a prefab, and then delete the original from the scene to keep it clean.
